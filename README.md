# Integrated Shopping Cart

> A Vue.js project

## Product Description

The product acts as a centralised shopping cart where items from multiple online stores can be
saved in one place. Once a user creates an account they are directed to an empty dashboard
where they can enter a link into a text box. Once a user enters a link from an online store, our
API will scrape any data from the web page, including images, title and price, and then store
that data to the userâ€™s profile and display it on their dashboard with a link back to the item's
original site. Items saved will be displayed in a Pinterest-like fashion on their dashboard, and
the saved items will be automatically prioritised based on our prioritisation algorithm.
